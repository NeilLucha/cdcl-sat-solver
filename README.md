# CDCL SAT Solver

A from-scratch implementation of the Conflict-Driven Clause Learning (CDCL) algorithm for solving Satisfiability (SAT) problem, written in Python



## Goals
- [ ] CNF Parsing
- [ ] Implement CDCL solver
- [ ] Try adding classical heuristics (like VSIDS) and other ML-based branching heuristics
- [ ] Evaluate performance

## To-Do List
- [ ] Set up the Project
- [ ] Start working on the code
