# CDCL SAT Solver

A from-scratch implementation of the Conflict-Driven Clause Learning (CDCL) algorithm for solving Satisfiability (SAT) problem, written in Python

NOTE: Works fine now

## Goals
- [x] Parsing DIMACS format
- [x] Implement a DPLL solver
- [x] Implement CDCL solver
- [x] Added VSIDS Heuristic
- [x] Evaluate performance
- [ ] Perform Comparative Analysis of DPLL, CDCL (with and w/o VSIDS)

## To-Do List
- [x] Set up the Project
- [x] Start working on the code
- [x] Test DPLL
- [x] Debug DPLL code (if required)
- [x] Test CDCL
- [x] Debug CDCL
- [ ] Comparative Analysis w/ and w/o VSIDS
