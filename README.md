# CDCL SAT Solver

A from-scratch implementation of the Conflict-Driven Clause Learning (CDCL) algorithm for solving Satisfiability (SAT) problem, written in Python



## Goals
- [x] Parsing DIMACS format
- [x] Implement a DPLL solver
- [ ] Implement CDCL solver
- [ ] Try adding classical heuristics (like VSIDS) and other ML-based branching heuristics
- [ ] Evaluate performance

## To-Do List
- [x] Set up the Project
- [x] Start working on the code
- [ ] Test DPLL
- [ ] Debug DPLL code (if required)
